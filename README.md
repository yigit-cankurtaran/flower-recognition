##Â Flower Recognition with a CNN

This is a simple CNN to recognize flowers. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) and contains 4242 images of flowers. The CNN is trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%. The CNN is implemented in Keras and the training is done locally on my M1 Macbook Air.
